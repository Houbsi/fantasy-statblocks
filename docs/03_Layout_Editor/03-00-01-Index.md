# The Layout Editor

New layouts are created through settings, either by clicking the "New Layout" button or copying an existing layout and clicking the "Edit" button.

This will open the layout creator, where layout blocks can be added and managed to the layout.

## Names

Layouts must be given names, and the names must be unique.

## Blocks

Statblock layouts are made up of blocks. There are several types of blocks, and each block can be associated to a monster property.

Blocks can be added to the layout by clicking the "Add Block" button, where the type of block may be selected.

Once a block is added to the layout, it may be edited by clicking the "Edit Block" button that appears when the block is hovered or removed by clicking the "Delete Block" button.

Additionally. blocks may be moved around by clicking the drag handle and dragging them around.

## Creating Blocks

A layout block has a type, and the type determines both how it renders and what options are available to the block. Once a block is created, its type cannot be changed.

Blocks have additional properties that will affect how it renders.

### Block Options

All blocks (except [Groups](03-01-Groups.md) and Inline) will have the following options:

| **Property**              | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Show Advanced Options** | A toggle for showing or hiding the Render as Markdown, Dice Callback, and Callback fields. This will automatically be enabled if "Show Advanced Options" is enabled in Layout Settings.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Link Monster Property** | The "property" or YAML "Key" the block will try to access on the monster object (for example, "name").                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Display Text**          | This is an override field as explained in the [Key](../02_Basics_of_Statblocks/02-05-Glossary.md#Key) section of the Glossary. This turns **HP**: 300 to **Health**: 300, if Health is set as the text in "Display Text".                                                                                                                                           |
| **Dice Callback**         | Requires [Dice Roller Plugin](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-dice-roller) . JavaScript code may be provided to determine how the string is parsed for dice. See [Callback Functions](../07_Callbacks/07-00-01-Index.md) for more information on Callbacks.                                                                                                |
| **Render as Markdown**    | A toggle to allow the block to render markdown styling such as italics and links. [Wrapped Strings](../02_Basics_of_Statblocks/02-05-Glossary.md#Wrapped%20Strings) are ***highly*** recommended when this option is enabled as some markdown styling will result in a [failed render](../08_Common_Troubleshooting/08-01-Statblock-Does-Not-Render.md) without it. |
| **Callbacks**             | JavaScript code may be provided to determine how the string is parsed for values. See [Callback Functions](../07_Callbacks/07-00-01-Index.md) for more information on Callbacks.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Conditional**           | If a block is set to conditional, it will not be rendered if the property does not exist.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Fallback**              | The fallback data to display if property does not exist, but the block is not toggled **Conditional**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Has Rule**              | A horizontal rule or bar will be displayed after the property                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Parse for Dice**        | A toggle which will prompt the plugin to attempt to parse for common dice roll strings from the block. See [Dice Rolls](../02_Basics_of_Statblocks/02-02-Creating-A-New-Entity.md#Dice%20Rolls).                                                                                                                                                                    |
|  **Link Dice to Property**                         | The layout will use the property provided to generate the dice roller. This is used if you want to have a different property perform the calculations for the dice roll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
