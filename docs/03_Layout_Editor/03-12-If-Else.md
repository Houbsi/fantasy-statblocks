# The If/Else Block

> **Warning**: This is an advanced block that requires basic knowledge of Javascript or some patience. Please read this guide carefully.

The If/Else Block is a conditional grouping block. Unlike the normal [Groups](03-01-Groups.md) block, the grouping is done by Javascript conditionals. The conditionals are set by reading the value of the Statblock key it is primed for, and processing the first instance of a *true* value that matches that instance.
