# Custom Layouts

In the [Layout Editor](../03_Layout_Editor/03-00-01-Index.md), we went over what each block does. In this section, we'll focus on making a custom layout. This section will be broken down into two main parts: design, and 

## Names

Layouts must be given names, and the names must be unique.

## Blocks

Statblock layouts are made up of blocks. There are several types of blocks, and each block can be associated to a monster property.

Blocks can be added to the layout by clicking the "Add Block" button, where the type of block may be selected. 

Once a block is added to the layout, it may be edited by clicking the "Edit Block" button that appears when the block is hovered or removed by clicking the "Delete Block" button.

Additionally. blocks may be moved around by clicking the drag handle and dragging them around.

## Creating Blocks

A layout block has a type, and the type determines both how it renders and what options are available to the block. Once a block is created, its type cannot be changed.

Blocks have additional properties that will affect how it renders.

### Block Options

All blocks (except group and inline) will have the following options:

| **Property**              | **Description**                                                                              |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Show Advanced Options** | A toggle for showing or hiding the Render as Markdown, Dice Callback, and Callback fields. This will automatically be enabled if "Show Advanced Options" is enabled in Layout Settings.                                                                                          |
| **Link Monster Property** | The "property" or YAML "Key" the block will try to access on the monster object (for example, "name"). |
Conditional	If a block is set to conditional, it won't be rendered if the property does not exist.
Fallback	Fallback to display if property does not exist but the block is not conditioned.
Has Rule	A horizontal rule will be displayed after the property
Parse for Dice*	The plugin will attempt to parse for common dice roll strings from the block
Link Dice to Property	The layout will use the property provided to generate the dice roller.
Dice Callback*â€ 	JavaScript code may be provided to determine how the string is parsed for dice.
